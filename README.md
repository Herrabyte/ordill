# √çslenskt Wordle

Simple implementation of the fantastic Wordle
(<https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/>) with an Icelandic dictionary, made
for fun as I am learning Icelandic.

## Building

Run the following commands:

```
yarn install
yarn build
```

to build the project. The output files will be placed in `./dist/` - open the
`index.html` file in a browser to run.
